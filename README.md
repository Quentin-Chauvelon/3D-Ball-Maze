# 3D Ball Maze 

This is the source code for an upcoming mobile/web game. 

3D Ball Maze is a casual game where the goal is to make a ball reach the target as fast as possible by rotating your phone to tilt and make your way through a maze while avoiding all the obstacles. 

It is being developed in C# using the Unity 3D game engine.  


# Status 

The project is under development (started in December 2023). It is currently in a prototyping state to validate the idea and making sure it could be fun to play.


# Project 

I am working on this as a side project since December 2023 (I actually started working on it in 2022 but had to pause the development because of a lot of schoolwork and to work on another project: [Social Media Simulator](https://github.com/Quentin-Chauvelon/Social_Media_Simulator)). I restarted from scratch in late 2023 as I felt the code I wrote back in 2022 was not great (it was my first time working with C#).

I learnt C# by myself by working on the first version of the project in 2022 and by reading [Apprenez � d�velopper en C#](https://www.fnac.com/a8267393/Nicolas-Hilaire-Apprenez-a-developper-en-c) written by Nicolas Hilaire.

As a solo developer on the project, I must work on all aspects of the game: coding, UI designing, 3D modeling, testing, fixing bugs... which will allow me to learn and improve a lot on all those aspects.  


# Inspiration

This project has been inspired by a minigame called Tilt Maze from the game Bomberman Land Wii. 

In this game, you rotate your Wii remote to tilt the maze and make the ball (top left of the image) reach the target (bottom right of the image) in the given timeframe. There are multiple levels that range in difficulty

I really liked playing this game when I was younger and wanted to try and make a more modern version of it as well as including more features that can be found in most games nowadays: 

- Social features such as playing with friends 
- Daily levels 
- Ranked levels with a global leaderboard 
- Cosmetics such as skin 
- Multiplayer 
- Events with custom game mechanics and rules 
- And much more...
